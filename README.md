Flask + D3 example
======

A simple demo that shows how to create a full stack visualization application that leverages the backend for loading only the data necessary (based on user parameters) for visualizing in the Front End.

This demo uses data from data.gov (Sorry I lost the detailed link), with historical information for th US States. It shows a choropleth map of the states, with the total Revenue per state. See a demo here: http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~jguerra/w209/
